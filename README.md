# 👋 Hi, I’m Gerry Díaz

I’m a systems-minded builder with roots in meteorology, a heart for community, and a drive to redesign how institutions respond to crisis. Whether I’m helping tribal partners strengthen flood preparedness, supporting cross-border coordination for extreme weather, or mapping out new public safety dashboards, my work lives at the intersection of service, science, and storytelling.

Right now, I serve as an emergency coordinator, but my path has woven through weather desks, wildfire ops, government briefings, digital design sprints, and late-night forecasts written to keep people calm and informed. I believe technical tools should feel human, and that good systems are built with care.

### 🌎 What I Build
- Climate risk dashboards and alert integration tools for local governments  
- Data visualizations that support equitable emergency planning  
- Communication strategies that bridge science and public trust

### 🛠 Tools and Technologies
Python • Pandas • GIS • NOAA/NWS APIs • Jupyter • ArcGIS • Git • Markdown  
Currently learning more about data automation, API design, and ethical tech for public systems

### 🎯 Current Role
**Emergency Services Coordinator**  
City and County of San Francisco

In this role, I support climate-related planning, response, and cross-agency coordination for extreme weather, wildfire risk, and long-term resilience strategy.

Previously, I served as:
- Associate Meteorologist for the County of San Diego, where I led alert system integration and supported flood mitigation efforts  
- Senior Newsroom Meteorologist at the San Francisco Chronicle, where I guided public-facing weather communication during California's extreme weather events  
- Meteorology Specialist at Southern California Edison, focusing on fire weather forecasting and operational decision support  
- Operational Meteorologist at the National Weather Service, supporting real-time forecast operations across multiple regions

### 📚 Background
- B.S. in Atmospheric Science  
- M.S. in Geoscience  
- Former public-facing meteorologist and newsroom leader  
- Experience across media, government, research, tribal partnerships, FEMA training, and digital design for federal systems

### 🌱 Looking Ahead
My work is shifting further into the spaces that connect people, policy, and preparedness. I’m especially focused on evolving how agencies coordinate during complex emergencies, how public messages are shaped across languages and communities, and how we build trust in systems long before a crisis arrives.

I’m interested in collaborations that merge civic design with climate data, that elevate equity in emergency response, and that treat communication not as a product—but as infrastructure.

If you’re building in those spaces too, let’s talk.
